  BITLOCKER RECOVERY KEY RETRIEVAL GUIDE
================================================================================

If your Windows system is protected by BitLocker encryption and you're seeing
a BitLocker recovery screen, you need your Recovery Key to unlock the drive.

================================================================================
WHERE TO FIND YOUR BITLOCKER RECOVERY KEY
================================================================================

Your BitLocker Recovery Key is a 48-digit number that was created when BitLocker
was first enabled. It should be saved in one of these locations:

1. MICROSOFT ACCOUNT (ONLINE)
   --------------------------
   If you signed in with a Microsoft account when setting up Windows:
   
   URL: https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey
   
   Steps:
   1. On another device (phone, tablet, or working computer), open a web browser
   2. Go to: https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey
   3. Sign in with the same Microsoft account used on your Windows PC
   4. Find your device in the list
   5. Click "Get recovery key" or "View recovery key"
   6. Copy the 48-digit recovery key
   7. Enter it on the BitLocker recovery screen

2. AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY (BUSINESS/SCHOOL ACCOUNTS)
   --------------------------------------------------
   If your PC is managed by an organization (work or school):
   
   URL: https://aka.ms/aadrecoverykey
   
   Steps:
   1. On another device, go to: https://aka.ms/aadrecoverykey
   2. Sign in with your work/school account
   3. Find your device and recovery key
   4. Copy the key and enter it on the BitLocker recovery screen

3. PRINTED OR SAVED COPY
   ----------------------
   Check if you:
   - Printed the recovery key when BitLocker was enabled
   - Saved it to a file (often named "BitLocker Recovery Key.txt")
   - Saved it to a USB drive
   - Wrote it down in a safe place

4. LOCAL GROUP POLICY (DOMAIN MANAGED)
   ------------------------------------
   If your PC is on a domain network, contact your IT administrator.
   They may have the recovery key stored in Active Directory.

================================================================================
HOW TO ENTER THE RECOVERY KEY
================================================================================

When you see the BitLocker recovery screen:

1. You'll see a prompt asking for the recovery key
2. Enter the 48-digit key (usually displayed in groups of 8 digits)
3. Press Enter
4. Windows should unlock the drive and continue booting

Format: XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX
        (8 digits - 8 digits - 8 digits - 8 digits - 8 digits - 8 digits)

================================================================================
IMPORTANT WARNINGS
================================================================================

⚠️  DO NOT MODIFY BOOT FILES WHILE BITLOCKER IS ACTIVE
   - Changing BCD, boot files, or BIOS settings while BitLocker is enabled
     can trigger BitLocker recovery
   - Always suspend BitLocker before making boot changes:
     manage-bde -protectors -disable C: -RebootCount 1

⚠️  IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RECOVERY KEY
   - Without the recovery key, you CANNOT access encrypted data
   - Microsoft cannot recover your key if you don't have it saved
   - Consider this before proceeding with boot repairs

⚠️  BACKUP YOUR RECOVERY KEY
   - Save your recovery key in multiple safe locations
   - Print a copy and keep it in a safe place
   - Store it in your Microsoft account for easy access

================================================================================
SUSPENDING BITLOCKER FOR BOOT REPAIRS
================================================================================

If you need to perform boot repairs and BitLocker is active:

1. Boot into Windows (if possible)
2. Open PowerShell as Administrator
3. Suspend BitLocker for one reboot:

   manage-bde -protectors -disable C: -RebootCount 1

4. Perform your boot repairs
5. BitLocker will automatically re-enable on the next boot

Note: This only works if you can boot into Windows. If you're already locked
      out, you'll need the recovery key first.

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE - RECOVERY KEY URLS
================================================================================

Personal Microsoft Account:
  https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey

Work/School Account (Azure AD):
  https://aka.ms/aadrecoverykey

Alternative (if above don't work):
  https://account.microsoft.com/account
  Then navigate to: Devices → Find your device → Recovery keys

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Problem: "I can't find my device on the Microsoft account page"
Solution:
  - Make sure you're signed in with the SAME Microsoft account
  - Check if the device name matches (it might be listed differently)
  - Try searching by the device's serial number
  - The device might be listed under a different account

Problem: "The recovery key doesn't work"
Solution:
  - Double-check you entered all 48 digits correctly
  - Make sure there are no spaces or dashes (or include them if the screen shows them)
  - Verify you're using the key for the correct drive (if multiple drives encrypted)
  - Try typing it slowly, one group at a time

Problem: "I don't have a Microsoft account"
Solution:
  - Check for a printed copy of the key
  - Check USB drives or external storage where you might have saved it
  - If it's a work/school PC, contact your IT administrator
  - If none of these work, you may need to perform a clean install (DATA LOSS)

Problem: "BitLocker keeps asking for recovery key after boot repair"
Solution:
  - This is normal if boot files were modified
  - Enter the recovery key once to unlock
  - BitLocker should resume normal operation after that
  - If it keeps asking, you may need to suspend BitLocker before repairs
